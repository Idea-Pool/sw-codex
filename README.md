# sw-codex

A project to demonstrate a UI testing solution with WebdriverIO, Puppeteer, and Teremock.

The project uses two sub-projects:

1.  **Service**
    The sub-project located in the `service` folder is a simple ReactJS based web application to be used in the tests, to demostrate the capabilities of the solution.
1.  **Test**
    The project located in the `test` folder contains the actual test code with the solution to mock requests of the service.

## Branches

The different states of the solution can be found on the following branches (all branch contains the previous):

1.  `part-1`: the service is implemented
1.  `part-2`: the tests are implemented
1.  `part-3`: basic mocking is enabled
1.  `part-4`: mocking definition logic is added
1.  `part-5`: mocks added, the final version of the code

The `master` branch only contains this information.
